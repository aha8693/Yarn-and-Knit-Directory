# Progress Log

## 2026-02-11
- Defined app concept: a yarn and knitting project organizer with three core areas:
  - Projects (FO, WIP, Planning)
  - Yarn Closet (in closet vs used up)
  - Interested Projects (Instagram/Ravelry links for future integration)
- Collected detailed field requirements for projects and yarn records.
- Discussed initial tech direction:
  - Frontend: React (JavaScript/TypeScript)
  - Backend/API: Python (FastAPI recommended for lightweight architecture)
  - Database: PostgreSQL recommended (MySQL still acceptable)
- Agreed to keep MVP lightweight and scalable for possible future subscription features.
- Requested to push code to git; git operations could not proceed from current folder because it was not detected as a git repository at that path.

## Next Steps
1. Confirm the repository root path and remote configuration.
2. Commit current project files.
3. Push to remote branch.
4. Start MVP scaffolding (auth, Projects, Yarn Closet, Interested Projects tabs).
